# `lengthen_date()`

## Testing

- Keep It Up:
- Nice incremental test suite. Good TDD

- Next steps:
- Make use of pytest [summary report flags](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/usage.html#detailed-summary-report) for output to the comandline instead of `print` statements. You could also make use of packages suck as [pytest-testdox](https://github.com/renanivo/pytest-testdox) to add structure to your test output.

## Code Quality

- Keep It Up:
    - Good command of the Python language so far, show great use of docs and online resources.
    - Lovely clean code and good semantics.

- Next steps:
    - Consider using a [match statement](https://speedsheet.io/s/python?q=cas#1Bmp) when conditional logic has many branches.
